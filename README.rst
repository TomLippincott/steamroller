SteamRoller is a framework for testing the performance of various machine learning models on different tasks in the broad area of "text classification".  It is designed to make it extremely easy to define new classification tasks, and new models, and drop them in to compare ther characteristics.  It discourages doing anything "special" for different tasks, models, or combinations thereof, to ensure the comparisons are fair and expose all the costs incurred by the different choices.

SteamRoller's user-facing functionality is reflected by four submodules:

1. tasks
2. models
3. metrics
4. plots

Under the hood, SteamRoller has three additional submodules:

1. tools
2. scons
3. ui

As explained below, changes to the code are usually unnecessary, as the most common conceptual classes (tasks and models) can be extended simply by editing the configuration file.

------
Getting started
------

SteamRoller and its dependencies can be installed with ``pip install steamroller --user``.  An empty directory can be initialized for performing experiments by executing ``steamroller init`` from therein.  This creates four files: *SConstruct*, and *steamroller_config.json* are the build system description and an example configuration file, respectively.  *csv/example.txt.gz* is a tab-separated file of texts drawn from Python documentation, and SteamRoller source code.  *tasks/example.tgz* is a Concrete archive of the same data, produced using the conversion tool described in this document.

The configuration file describes 150 experiments using the example data across several axes: 5 random folds, 5 model types, and 6 sizes of training data.  They can be run locally, in serial, with::

  steamroller run

This takes about 6 minutes to complete on a typical laptop.  This can be sped up by using multiple threads to build targets in parallel, e.g. you can cut the runtime in half on a dual-core machine with::

  steamroller run -j 2

In general, any options accepted by SCons can be included after ``steamroller run``: the only exception is the ``--config`` option, which lets you specify a different SteamRoller configuration file.  To get a list of SCons options, you can run ``steamroller run -h``.  For heavy-duty experiments, you might want to use the HPC functionality described below.

Inspecting results
----

Once the experiments have finished, you will want to compare their performance.  Generally, the final product of a set of SteamRoller experiments is a plot of some metric (accuracy, run-time, memory usage, etc) with respect to some other variable (number of training examples, hyper-parameter value, etc).  Running ``steamroller serve`` will, by default, start a web server at *http://localhost:8080* with links to the plots generated for each task, or you can examine the figures directly in the *work/* subdirectory.

----
Using an HPC Grid
----

By default, *steamroller_config.json* has ``"GRID" : false``, and experiments will run serially on the local machine.  If you are running on an HPC grid like Univa, Sun Grid Engine, or Torque, setting ``"GRID" : true`` instructs SteamRoller to run experiments via the *qsub* command.  Since the jobs are distributed across the grid, the invocation of SteamRoller will submit them and then *wait* until they have completed, polling the scheduler and printing the current number of running jobs.  If you interrupt the SteamRoller command in this state, *the grid jobs will continue to run*, so you can either allow them to do so (e.g. if the interruption was accidental), or manually kill the running jobs with a command like ``qdel -u USERNAME``.  The latter is particularly important if you want to change and rerun experiments, as otherwise you may have multiple jobs simultaneously building the same output file.

----
Defining a new task
----

In SteamRoller, a *task* is simply a pointer to documents annotated with discrete labels.  For example, the default *steamroller_config.json* file has the following entry::

   "TASKS" : [
     {"NAME" : "ExampleTask",
      "FILE" : "tasks/example.tgz"
     }
   ]

That's it.  We use the *Concrete* data format, so the file is a tar archive where each entry is a *Communication* object, but SteamRoller has functionality to convert from a simple text format like that of the auto-generated ``csv/example.txt.gz`` file.  If your data is a text file with lines in tab-separated format::

  ID LABEL TEXT

you can create an appropriate Concrete tar archive by running ``python -m steamroller.tools.convert -i TEXT_FILE -o TAR_FILE``.  Make sure that any tab characters in the text column are appropriately escaped (SteamRoller uses Python's *csv* module).
  
----
Defining a new model
----

A *model* in SteamRoller is defined by the command-line processes for:

1. Training based on some data
2. Applying to some new data

Looking again at the default *steamroller_config.json*, there is an entry::

  "MODELS" : [
      {"NAME" : "SVM",
      "TRAIN_COMMAND" : "python -m steamroller.models.scikit_learn --type svm --train ${SOURCES[0]} --input ${SOURCES[1]} --output ${TARGETS[0]} --max_ngram ${MAX_NGRAM}",
      "APPLY_COMMAND" : "python -m steamroller.models.scikit_learn --type svm --model ${SOURCES[0]} --test ${SOURCES[1]} --input ${SOURCES[2]} --output ${TARGETS[0]}"
      }
    ]

*train_command*, when the template strings are replaced by SteamRoller, will train an SVM based on an input file (i.e. the tar archive mentioned earlier) and a train file that is a list of indices in the tar file.  The resulting SVM is serialized into the output file.  Note the MAX_NGRAM template string: this is a *hyper-parameter* that you might set directly in the *steamroller_config.py* file, or perhaps perform grid search over to find optimal values.

*apply_command*, again once the template strings are replaced, will read in a serialized SVM and apply it to the instances specified in *--test*.  It writes log-probabilities to the output file in the tab-separated format::

  ID     GOLD   LABEL1 LABEL2 ...
  321321 LABEL2 -.03   -.0025

SteamRoller comes with several common models predefined based on the Scikit-Learn suite, which is why these commands are invoking parts of SteamRoller itself, but the only requirement is that the commands meet the criteria described above and can run on the relevant machines (locally or across a grid).

---
The metrics database
---

After all experiments have been run, you will have a lot of files ending in *probabilities.txt.gz*.  Each of these is the result of applying a particular *model file* to a particular *data file*, in the tab-separated format produced by an *apply_command* described in the previous section.

----
Defining a new plot
----

Plots, which used to be hard-coded, are now specified in the configuration file (currently, this is experimental).  Basically, you can specify the X and Y axes, and coloring, to be any of the *metric* values computed over the experiments, or any of *size*, *model*, *fold*, *task*.  For example, the default configuration has::

  "FIGURES" : [
	{"NAME" : "fscore",
	 "TITLE" : "Average F-Score",
	 "TYPE" : "whisker",
	 "XLABEL" : "Training instances",
	 "X" : "size",
	 "YLABEL" : "Average F-Score",
	 "Y" : "F_Score",
	 "COLOR_LABEL" : "Model type",	 
	 "COLOR" : "model",
	},
	...

This is asking for a *whisker* plot (currently the only type implemented), where the X-axis is the training *size*, Y-axis is the f-score, and the points are colored by the model type.  Other values (namely, *fold*) are aggregated over and used to compute the variance.  Each plot is performed per-task.
